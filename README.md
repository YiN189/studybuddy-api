## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose

### Running with Docker Compose

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd project2

# Create .env file for backend
echo "MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority" > .env
echo "MONGODB_DB=studybuddy" >> .env

# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build -d
```

The application will be available at your server's domain or `http://localhost`.

| Service | Internal Port | Exposed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nginx proxy | 80 / 443 | 80, 443 (main entry point) |
| Frontend (Vite/Nginx) | 80 | via Nginx proxy |
| Backend (Next.js) | 3000 | via Nginx proxy at `/api/` |

### Seeding the Database

```bash
# Run the seed script to populate sample data
cd studybuddy-api
node src/scripts/seed.js
```

This inserts sample users, courses, categories, questions, and reports.

**Demo Accounts:**

| Role | Email | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Student | john@example.com | student123 |
| Instructor | jinchun@example.com | instructor123 |
| Admin | admin@example.com | admin123 |

---

## Environment Variables

### Backend (.env)

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `MONGODB_URI` | MongoDB connection string |
| `MONGODB_DB` | Database name (default: `studybuddy`) |

---

## Notes

- Quizzes are stored as **embedded documents** within the Course collection, following MongoDB's embedded document pattern.
- Enrollment and progress are tracked within the User document (`enrolledCourses`, `completedLessons`, `quizScores` arrays).
- The frontend repo is at: https://github.com/Shunelw/StudyBuddy
- `docker-compose.yml` is included in this repo. To run the full stack, clone both repos side by side:
  ```
  project2/
  ├── studybuddy-api/   ← this repo (https://github.com/YiN189/studybuddy-api)
  └── StudyBuddy/       ← frontend repo (https://github.com/Shunelw/StudyBuddy)
  ```
  Then run `docker-compose up --build -d` from inside `studybuddy-api/`.
